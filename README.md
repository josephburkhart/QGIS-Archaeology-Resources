This repository contains QGIS symbol sets, composer templates, and SVG files for archaeological applications. Most of these resources were created by me, but some of them were created by others who have granted me permission to include them here.

This repository follows the structure required by the popular QGIS plugin [QGIS Resource Sharing](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgis_resource_sharing/), so QGIS users should be able to install this repository using that plugin.
